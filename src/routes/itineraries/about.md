The BELvue is located in the heart of Brussels and is both the museum of Belgium and its history as well as a centre for democracy.

Managed by the [King Baudouin Foundation](https://www.kbs-frb.be), the BELvue was created as a place where visitors, and especially young people, can learn about and better understand Belgium, its history, its socio-economic development and the workings of its institutions.

Employing a theme-based approach and with a modern, interactive exhibition layout, the museum offers visitors the keys to understanding Belgium and Belgian society.

The BELvue also organises temporary exhibitions which give the opportunity to the visitor to discover in depth a special topic, dedicated to history, to heritage or to more recent events of the country.

Next to its museum activities, the BELvue is also a centre for democracy. It contributes to improving the confidence in democratic values by developing a historical conscience and by stimulating critical reflexion on major democratic stakes.

The BELvue also welcomes a large diversity of visitors: schools, (future) teachers, youth associations, families, seniors, vulnerable people, as well as disabled people, ... They benefit from a large and appropriate offer of activities, exhibitions, workshops, guided tours, conferences or events around democracy, history and justice.

To complete this accessible approach, most of the activities are free of charge or available at democratic prices.

The BELvue is located in Brussels, Belgian and European capital city, next to the Royal Palace and neighbour of the greatest national institutions. It aims to be a place to meet and to exchange ideas, a place where past, present and future gather.
